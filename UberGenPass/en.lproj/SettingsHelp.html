    <h3>Master Password</h3>
    <p>On first use, type your SuperGenPass master password into the two <b>Master Password</b> text fields. The status indicator to the right of the Master Password label changes color as you type. Green <img class="status" src="../GreenStatus.png"> indicates that the two passwords match. Red <img class="status" src="../RedStatus.png"> indicates that one or more characters do not match. Yellow <img class="status" src="../YellowStatus.png"> indicates that the fields match so far, but one field is shorter than the other.</p>
      <p>UberGenPass stores a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256 hash</a> of your master password in the secure iOS Keychain. (Note that UberGenPass never stores your password itself anywhere.) After you have set a master password, you need only type the password once and the app will recognize when it is correct. To change your master password, tap the <b>Change</b> button and the second text field will be redisplayed.</p>
      <h3>Save Recent Sites</h3>
      <p>If you enable <b>Save Recent Sites</b>, UberGenPass keeps a list of recent sites for which a password has been generated. These sites are used to populate a suggestion list that updates as you type a site name. Recent sites are stored in the secure iOS Keychain and cleared when you disable the feature.</p>
      <h3>Background Timeout</h3>
      <p>The <b>Background Timeout</b> setting determines how long UberGenPass can be running in the background before asking for your master password again when relaunched. By default, this is set to the most secure option, "immediately". You can optionally suppress this for up to five minutes.</p>
      <h3>Add Safari Bookmarklet</h3>
      <p>If you tap <b>Add Safari Bookmarklet</b>, UberGenPass will open a page in Safari describing how to integrate the two apps for faster workflow. Using the bookmarklet in Safari lets you launch UberGenPass directly from a web page with the URL of the page already filled in for you.</p>
