  <h3>Master Password</h3>
  <p>Type your SuperGenPass password into both <b>Master Password</b> text fields. The status indicator between the fields changes color as you type. Green<img class="status" src="green.png">indicates that the two passwords match exactly. Red<img class="status" src="red.png">indicates that one or more characters do not match.  Yellow<img class="status" src="yellow.png">indicates that the passwords match so far, but one field is shorter than the other.</p>
  <p><b>Tip:</b> You may find it easier to enter the passwords with the device rotated to landscape.</p>
  <h3>Save Password Hash</h3>
  <p>Typing the master password twice reduces the chance of a mistake, but it can become tiresome. If you enable <b>Save Password Hash</b>, UberGenPass saves a 256-byte (SHA-256) hash of your master password in the secure iOS Keychain. In this case, as soon as the password you type in the left field matches the hash, the right field is filled in for you.</p>
  <h3>Background Timeout</h3>
  <p>The <b>Background Timeout</b> setting determines how long UberGenPass can be in the background before asking for your master password again. By default, this is the most secure option, immediately. You can optionally bypass this for up to five minutes.</p>
  <h3>Add Safari Bookmarklet</h3>
  <p>If you tap <b>Add Safari Bookmarket</b>, UberGenPass will open a page in Safari describing how to integrate the two apps for faster workflow. Adding a bookmarket to Safari lets you launch UberGenPass directly from a web page with the URL of the page already filled in for you, and also return to the page in Safari directly from UberGenPass.
