    <h3>Master Password</h3>
    <p>Type your SuperGenPass master password into the <b>Master Password</b> text field. When the text matches your password, the status indicator to the right of the Master Password label change to green.  Tap <b>Done</b> to continue.

    <h3>Save Recent Sites</h3>
    <p>If you enable <b>Save Recent Sites</b>, UberGenPass keeps a list of recent sites for which a password has been generated. These sites are used to populate a suggestion list that updates as you type a site name. Recent sites are stored in the secure iOS Keychain and cleared when you disable the feature.</p>

    <h3>Background Timeout</h3>
    <p>The <b>Background Timeout</b> setting determines how long UberGenPass can be running in the background before asking for your master password again when relaunched. By default, this is set to the most secure option, "immediately". You can optionally suppress this for up to five minutes.</p>

    <h3>Add Safari Bookmarklet</h3>
    <p>If you tap <b>Add Safari Bookmarklet</b>, UberGenPass will open a page in Safari describing how to integrate the two apps for faster workflow. Using the bookmarklet in Safari lets you launch UberGenPass directly from a web page with the URL of the page already filled in for you.</p>
